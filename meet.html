      <h3>Austen Clarke</h3>
      <span class="post">Director</span>
      <div class="pic"></div>
      <p>You could say that property development is in Austen’s blood – and with his introduction to it coming from his mum in his late teens, it is perhaps unsurprising that Clarke Group is doing what it’s doing today.</p>
      <p>Starting his property development career in Hamilton, New Zealand, in 2001, Austen has years of property development experience – with many successes and the odd failure along the way providing him with countless lessons for what works and what doesn’t.</p>
      <p>He took these lessons and wrote the thesis for his MBA (Distinction) on the feasibility of launching this model in Auckland before founding the Clarke Group in 2013.</p>
      <p>A strong believer in surrounding yourself with smart people, he soon bought on broad skilled and trusted team members to work alongside him and challenge him to always do even better.</p>
